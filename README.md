# Another MVC Tech Blog

## Description 
This tech blog is a site for blogging about things related to technology.  Users can sign up and then log in to add blog posts about whatever they might think is interesting.

## Installation Process
Clone this repo - run "npm install" in the root directory - the .env file is included for convenience so you should then be able to run "npm start" to launch the application. 
The application works fine locally, but opening it through the Heroku link does not work due to some kind of error in Heroku's convoluted precesses.
